This project is a web-based Pokédex built using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive applications. The app allows users to search for and explore detailed information about various Pokémon, including their basic stats, breeding, training details, and radar charts of their attributes. The data used is sourced from a Pokémon dataset on Kaggle, and images are displayed based on the Pokémon’s specific form or type.

# Features
* Search by Name: Users can search for a Pokémon by name. The app will provide a list of matches based on partial input.
* Filter by Base Stats: The app allows filtering Pokémon by ranges of base stats such as HP, Attack, Speed, etc.
# Detailed Information:
- Basic Information: Pokémon name, ID, height, weight, species, and abilities.
- Base Stats & Type Defenses: Visual representation of base stats and weaknesses or resistances against different types.
- Training & Breeding: Information on catch rate, base experience, egg types, gender ratio, and egg cycles.
- Radar Chart: A radar chart displaying the base stats of a Pokémon.
- Search for Similar Pokémon: After viewing a Pokémon's stats, the user can search for Pokémon with similar base stats.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the pokedex.csv file, which contains detailed information about each Pokémon. It includes fields like name, types, abilities, base stats, height, weight, species, and more.

# Acknowledgments
This project was developed as part of a guided project by Damian Boh, using datasets and images sourced from Pokémon content available on Kaggle.
